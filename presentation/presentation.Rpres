Probability of survival:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)  

ages <- c("adult", "child")
sex <- c("female", "male")

df <- expand.grid(sex, ages)
n <- nrow(data)

df$value <- round(as.vector(survival.table), 2)    

g <- 
  ggplot(df, aes(Var1, Var2)) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = value), colour = "green") + theme_bw() + xlab("Age") + 
  ylab("Sex")
g + scale_size_continuous(range=c(10, 60)) + geom_text(aes(label = value))
```
